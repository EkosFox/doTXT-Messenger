TKINTER IS NEEDED !

To use doTXT PyMessenger you need to modify the conf.py file to set
the rooms' location and your username. Then simply run dotxt.pyw

To connect to the rooms you can use "list rooms" as a guide to select it.
Enter the name of the room (without extension ".txt") on the box and press "join room".



-Future improvements and features-
-. Emojis! (Done!)
1. Music streaming (Peharps after an alpha release and the major bugs fixed)
2. Design Improvement (Changing periodically on the releases, bugs fix is on top priority though.)
3. Auto-update (That will save your time!)
4. Multiple chats at same time (Difficult -_-' , but I will work that out!)
5. Play sound when new messages arrive and your focus isn't on the window (Easy, uses Pygame though. Need to update Python in this folder...)
