TKINTER IS NEEDED !

To use doTXT PyMessenger you need to modify the conf.py file to set
the rooms' location and your username. Then simply run dotxt.pyw

To connect to the rooms you can use "list rooms" as a guide to select it.
Enter the name of the room (without extension ".txt") on the box and press "join room".



-Future improvements and features-
-. Emojis! (Done!)
1. Music streaming (Peharps after an alpha release and the major bugs fixed)
2. Design Improvement (Changing periodically on the releases, bugs fix is on top priority though.)
3. Auto-update (That will save your time!)
4. Multiple chats at same time (Difficult -_-' , but I will work that out!)
5. Play sound when new messages arrive and your focus isn't on the window (Easy, uses Pygame though. Need to update Python in this folder...)

Developer Words:
Well, I made this project when some friends in my Computer Science class where things about doing the same but on terminal, 
which is an horrible idea because on terminal the input and print of data couldn't happen. 
Then I decided to do it but in tkinter (with implementation of pygame).
Because not all the computers in my school have python, I decided to copy mine that was on USB flash drive to the Shared folder on school. 
Minutes later my account was blocked LMFAO. Fortunately my account was unblocked after explaining the facts to the Technicians Team. 
Sadly they didn't allowed the development of any kind of messenger programs.      ¯\_(ツ)_/¯     ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I wasn't planning to make it open source so soon, but I have no reason to developing it as no one is gonna use it.
Have fun using it, just don't get into trouble like I did xD.
